This repository contains my work on **Computational Optimal Recovery**: the research articles and the accompanying reproducible files.
In reverse chronological order (of submission, not publication), these articles are:

- Optimal recovery from inaccurate data in Hilbert spaces: regularize, but what of the parameter? With C. Liao. | 
[PDF](https://github.com/foucart/COR/Papers/07_ORHilbert_Reg.pdf) 
/ 
[MATLAB](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/foucart/COR/MATLAB/web/07_ORHilbert_Reg_repro.html)

For a more direct access to html versions of the reproducibles (when available), simply click on the links above.
The raw codes, available in MATLAB and in Python, are located inside the folders called "MATLAB" and "Python". 
To execute these reproducibles, additional software is sometimes required, in particular:
- in MATLAB, Chebfun (https://www.chebfun.org/) may be necessary;
- in MATLAB, CVX (http://cvxr.com/cvx/) may be necessary;
- in Python, CVXPY (https://www.cvxpy.org/) may be necessary.
